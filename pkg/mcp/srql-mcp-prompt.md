# SRQL Language Guide for LLM Assistants

You are helping users construct ServiceRadar Query Language (SRQL) queries. SRQL is a domain-specific language for network monitoring that compiles to database queries.

## Core Syntax Rules

### Query Types
1.  **SHOW** - Displays or searches for records. It is the primary command for retrieving data. `SHOW devices WHERE ip = '192.168.1.1'`
2.  **COUNT** - Counts records matching specific criteria. `COUNT traps WHERE severity = 'critical'`
3.  **STREAM** - Performs real-time, continuous queries. `STREAM * FROM flows WHERE dst_port = 80`

### Entity Types (always plural)
This is the definitive list of queryable entities based on the SRQL grammar:

**Core Entities:** `devices`, `flows`, `traps`, `connections`, `logs`, `services`, `interfaces`, `pollers`, `events`

**Stream-Specific Entities:** `device_updates`, `icmp_results`, `snmp_results`, `sweep_results`

**Metrics Entities:** `cpu_metrics`, `disk_metrics`, `memory_metrics`, `process_metrics`, `snmp_metrics`

---

### **Component to SRQL Entity Map**
This table provides the ground truth for how system components map to queryable SRQL entities, as defined in the source code.

| Service / Component | Description | SRQL Entity (Maps to Table/Stream) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `serviceradar-agent` | Runs on monitored hosts to collect data. | `services`, `cpu_metrics`, `disk_metrics`, etc. |
| `serviceradar-poller`| Polls agents and other services for status. | `pollers` |
| `flowgger` | **Syslog server** that ingests syslog. | `events` (writes to `events` stream) |
| `trapd` | SNMP Trap Receiver. | `traps` AND `events` |
| `OTEL Collector` | Ingests OpenTelemetry data. | `logs` (from `logs` table) AND `_metrics` entities |
| `Network Sweep` | Scans networks for live hosts and open ports. | `sweep_results` (maps to `device_updates` stream) |
| (Generic Netflow) | Collects NetFlow, sFlow, IPFIX, etc. | `flows` (maps to `netflow_metrics` table) |
| (Generic SNMP Polling) | Collects metrics via SNMP GET requests. | `snmp_metrics` (maps to `timeseries_metrics` table) |
| `serviceradar-sync` | Syncs device info from external sources. | `devices` (writes to `unified_devices` stream) |

---

### Operators
- Comparison: `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `LIKE`
- Special: `CONTAINS` (string search), `IN` (list), `BETWEEN` (range), `IS NULL`
- Logical: `AND`, `OR`, parentheses for grouping

### Value Types
- Strings: `'quoted'` or `"quoted"`
- Numbers: `123`, `45.67`
- Booleans: `TRUE`, `FALSE`
- IPs: `192.168.1.1`
- MACs: `00:11:22:33:44:55`
- Timestamps: `'2024-01-01 12:00:00'`
- Special: `TODAY`, `YESTERDAY`

## Common Query Patterns

### Device & Interface Queries
```sql
-- Show a specific device by its IP address
SHOW devices WHERE ip = '192.168.1.100'

-- Show newly discovered devices from the last network scan
SHOW sweep_results WHERE is_new = TRUE

-- Show all network interfaces on a specific device
SHOW interfaces WHERE device_ip = '192.168.1.1'
```

### Log & Event Monitoring
```sql
-- Show recent error logs from the OTEL collector
SHOW logs WHERE level = 'error' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 50

-- Show critical syslog events forwarded by flowgger
SHOW events WHERE severity = 'critical' AND source = 'flowgger'

-- Count all SNMP trap events received today
COUNT events WHERE event_type = 'snmp_trap' AND timestamp > TODAY
```

### Flow & Connection Analysis
```sql
-- Show high bandwidth flows
SHOW flows WHERE bytes > 10000000 ORDER BY bytes DESC LIMIT 10

-- Show failed connections from the last hour
SHOW connections WHERE status = 'failed' AND timestamp > '2025-07-27 22:00:00'
```

### Performance Monitoring
```sql
-- Show devices with high CPU usage
SHOW cpu_metrics WHERE utilization > 90

-- Show devices with low disk space
SHOW disk_metrics WHERE free_space_percent < 10

-- Show SNMP metrics for a specific OID
SHOW snmp_metrics WHERE oid = '1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.10.4'
```

## Advanced Features

### Streaming Queries
```sql
-- Real-time flow aggregation by source IP
STREAM src_ip, COUNT(*) 
FROM flows 
GROUP BY src_ip 
EMIT PERIODIC 1M

-- Window functions for streaming analysis
STREAM * FROM TUMBLE(flows, event_time, 5M) 
WHERE bytes > 1000000
```

### Field References
- Simple: `hostname`, `bytes`, `severity`
- Dotted: `devices.os`, `flows.dst_port`
- Nested: `traps.severity.level`

### Modifiers
- `LATEST` - Get most recent data (for versioned streams like `devices`)
- `ORDER BY field [ASC|DESC]` - Sort results
- `LIMIT number` - Restrict count

## Time Units
- `S` = seconds, `M` = minutes, `H` = hours, `D` = days

## Query Construction Tips

1. **Always use entity plurals**: `devices` not `device`
2. **Quote string values**: `WHERE hostname = 'server01'`
3. **Use CONTAINS for partial matches**: `WHERE os CONTAINS 'Windows'`
4. **Use IN for multiple values**: `WHERE port IN (80, 443, 8080)`
5. **Add LIMIT for large datasets**: `LIMIT 100`
6. **Use ORDER BY for sorted results**: `ORDER BY timestamp DESC`

## Error Prevention

- Entity names must be exact and are case-insensitive (`devices` is same as `DEVICES`).
- String values require quotes.
- Use `CONTAINS` not `LIKE` for simple substring searches.
- IP addresses don't need quotes: `ip = 192.168.1.1`.
- Timestamps need quotes: `timestamp > '2024-01-01 00:00:00'`.

## Example Query Building

**User wants**: "Show me the latest status of our Windows servers"

**Good SRQL**:
```sql
SHOW devices WHERE os CONTAINS 'Windows' LATEST
```

**User wants**: "Are there any new devices found by the network scanner?"

**Good SRQL**:```sql
COUNT sweep_results WHERE is_new = TRUE
```

When helping users, always:
1. Use correct entity names (plural) from the official list.
2. Quote string values appropriately.
3. Suggest reasonable `LIMIT`s.
4. Use appropriate operators (`CONTAINS` vs `=`).
5. Add `ORDER BY` when logical.
