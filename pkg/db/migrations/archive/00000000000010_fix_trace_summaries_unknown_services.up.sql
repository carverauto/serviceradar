-- == Fix Trace Summaries Unknown Services Migration
-- =================================================================
-- This migration fixes the issue where traces show as "unknown/unknown service"
-- and missing durations by recreating the materialized view with proper logic

-- Drop and recreate both the stream and materialized view
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS otel_trace_summaries_final_mv;
DROP STREAM IF EXISTS otel_trace_summaries_final;

-- Recreate the stream
CREATE STREAM IF NOT EXISTS otel_trace_summaries_final (
  timestamp             DateTime64(9),
  trace_id              string,
  root_span_id          string,
  root_span_name        string,
  root_service_name     string,
  root_span_kind        int32,
  start_time_unix_nano  uint64,
  end_time_unix_nano    uint64,
  duration_ms           float64,
  span_count            uint32,
  error_count           uint32,
  status_code           int32,
  service_set           array(string)
) ENGINE = Stream(1, 1, rand())
ORDER BY (timestamp, trace_id);

-- Recreate the materialized view with proper defaults and direct span data
