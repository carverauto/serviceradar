### How to Report
- **Email**: Send a detailed report to [security@serviceradar.cloud](mailto:security@serviceradar.cloud).

### What to Include

### Our Response Process
1. **Acknowledgment**: We’ll confirm receipt of your report within 48 hours.
2. **Investigation**: We’ll assess the vulnerability and determine its severity, typically within 5 business days.
3. **Updates**: You’ll receive periodic updates (approximately every 7-14 days) on our progress until the issue is resolved.
4. **Resolution**: If the vulnerability is validated, we’ll work on a fix and release it in a supported version. If declined (e.g., out-of-scope, not reproducible, or not a security issue), we’ll provide an explanation.

### Expectations

- **Declined Reports**: We’ll let you know why the report didn’t qualify as a security issue and offer guidance if applicable.
