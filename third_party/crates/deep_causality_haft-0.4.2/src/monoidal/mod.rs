//! # The symmetric-monoidal PROP: copy `Δ`, discard `ε`, merge `∇`, swap `σ`
//!
//! The generators of the symmetric-monoidal structure the effect graph is built in. The monoidal
//! product is the cartesian product (a pair `(A, B)`) with unit the terminal object `()`; the
//! carrier is any value, and — where merging is needed — any [`Monoid`].
//!
//! - **Copy comonoid `(Δ, ε)`.** In a cartesian category every object carries a *unique*
//!   cocommutative comonoid: the diagonal [`copy`](SymMonoidal::copy) `A → A ⊗ A` and the discard
//!   [`discard`](SymMonoidal::discard) `A → I` (T. Fox, "Coalgebras and Cartesian Categories,"
//!   *Comm. Algebra* 4(7), 1976). Coassociativity, counit, and cocommutativity therefore hold
//!   structurally.
//! - **Merge monoid `(∇, η)`.** The multiplication [`merge`](SymMonoidal::merge) `A ⊗ A → A` and
//!   unit [`unit`](SymMonoidal::unit) `I → A` are exactly a [`Monoid`]'s `combine`/`empty`, so the
//!   merge-monoid associativity and unit laws *are* the monoid laws. This `∇` is the substrate the
//!   deferred reconvergence-merge extension consumes — two effect branches fuse through `combine`.
//! - **Symmetry `σ`.** The braiding [`swap`](SymMonoidal::swap) `A ⊗ B → B ⊗ A` is its own inverse
//!   (`σ ∘ σ = id`), making the monoidal structure symmetric (Mac Lane, *CWM* §XI.1).
//! - **Copy–merge coherence.** `Δ` is a monoid homomorphism (`Δ(x ∇ y) = Δx ∇ Δy`, the bialgebra
//!   law), which holds for every monoid in a cartesian category; over a
//!   [`CommutativeMonoid`](deep_causality_algebra::CommutativeMonoid) `∇` is additionally invariant
//!   under `σ` (`∇ ∘ σ = ∇`).
//!
//! This module supplies the algebraic **substrate only**; the graph wiring that consumes `∇` for
//! branch reconvergence is out of scope here (it is the deferred reconvergence-merge extension).
//!
//! Laws are machine-checked in `lean/DeepCausalityFormal/Haft/SymmetricMonoidal.lean`
//! (`haft.monoidal.{comonoid_laws, merge_monoid_laws, symmetry}`) and witnessed in
//! `deep_causality_haft/tests/formalization_lean/monoidal_tests.rs`.
