# ServiceRadar Project Roadmap

## Overview

ServiceRadar is an open-source network management and observability platform designed to be distributed, fast, and easy to use. This roadmap outlines our vision for the project as we prepare for donation to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

## Elevator Pitch

ServiceRadar is a distributed network monitoring and observability platform that works seamlessly across bare metal, Docker, and Kubernetes environments. It provides comprehensive network visibility through log collection, SNMP and Network Management APIs, metric polling, and network discoveryâ€”all queryable through an intuitive DSL called SRQL. Built for performance and scalability, ServiceRadar delivers enterprise-grade observability without the enterprise price tag.
