ServiceRadar is a distributed network monitoring system designed for infrastructure and services in hard to reach places or constrained environments.
It provides real-time monitoring of internal services, with cloud-based alerting capabilities to ensure you stay informed even during network or power outages.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Monitor services and infrastructure in hard-to-reach places
- **Distributed Architecture**: Components can be installed across different hosts to suit your needs
- **Stream Processing**: Timeplus stream processing engine -- streaming OLAP w/ ClickHouse
- **Observability**: Collect metrics, logs, and traces from SNMP, OTEL, and SYSLOG
- **Network Mapper**: Discovery Engine uses SNMP/LLDP/CDP and API to discover devices, interfaces, and topology
- **Security**: Support for mTLS to secure communications between components and API key authentication for web UI
- **Rule Engine**: Blazing fast rust-based rule processing engine
- **Specialized Monitoring**: Support for specific node types like Dusk Network nodes

## Quick Installation

ServiceRadar provides a simple installation script for deploying all components:

```bash
# All-in-One Installation (non-interactive mode)
curl -sSL https://github.com/carverauto/serviceradar/releases/download/1.0.48/install-serviceradar.sh | bash -s -- --all --non-interactive
```

For detailed installation options including component-specific deployments and optional checkers, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Architecture Overview

ServiceRadar uses a distributed architecture with four main components:

1. **Agent** - Runs on monitored hosts, provides service status through gRPC
2. **Poller** - Coordinates monitoring activities, can run anywhere in your network
3. **Core Service** - Receives reports from pollers, provides API, and sends alerts
4. **Web UI** - Provides a modern dashboard interface with Nginx as a reverse proxy

## Performance

ServiceRadar powered by [Timeplus Proton](https://github.com/timeplus-io/proton) can deliver 90 million EPS, 4 millisecond end-to-end latency, and high cardinality aggregation with 1 million unique keys on an Apple Macbook Pro with M2 MAX.
