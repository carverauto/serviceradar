# ServiceRadar v1.0.64

Edge onboarding support for Rust sysmon checker.

## Whats New

**1.0.64**
- Added edge onboarding library (`rust/edge-onboarding`) for Rust-based checkers, mirroring the Go `pkg/edgeonboarding` package.
- Integrated mTLS bootstrap into the sysmon checker with `--mtls`, `--token`, `--host`, and `--cert-dir` CLI flags.
- Supports `ONBOARDING_TOKEN` environment variable for zero-touch token-based installation.
- Generates and persists checker configuration from onboarding packages with proper certificate permissions.
- Updated AGENTS.md with edge onboarding testing playbook for Docker mTLS Compose stack.

# ServiceRadar v1.0.63

Next.js/React security patch and AGE graph permissions fix.

## Whats New

**1.0.63**
- Updated the web UI to Next.js 16.0.7 with react-dom 19.2.1 to remediate December 2025 advisories; rebuilt/pushed images (`sha-a85eb7e52726a5471913d0ba61d20ceb2d4d35da`) and refreshed the demo release.
- Hardened AGE graph bootstrap migrations with explicit extension/sequence grants and idempotent search_path defaults so CNPG upgrades no longer fail on permissions.
- Bumped SPIRE controller-manager resources and kept helm/chart defaults aligned with the new image tag.

# ServiceRadar v1.0.62

sysmon-vm renamed to sysmon-osx and security updates.

## Whats New

**1.0.62**
- Renamed sysmon-vm to sysmon-osx to better reflect macOS-specific system monitoring functionality.
- Updated React and Next.js dependencies with latest security patches.

# ServiceRadar v1.0.61

Device registry backed by Apache AGE plus refreshed UI.

## Whats New

**1.0.61**

- Shipped UI updates to surface the new graph data and align the device views with the registry changes.

# ServiceRadar v1.0.60

mTLS compose sysmon canonicalization and release rebuild.

## Whats New

**1.0.60**
- Fixed sysmon ingestion to resolve canonical device IDs so UI/device sysmon CPU panels now show data for mTLS sysmon-osx checkers (e.g., `sr:88239dc2-7208-4c24-a396-3f868c2c9419`).
- Rebuilt/pushed all compose-mtls images with tag `sha-0bc21e5ee79be0eb143cddd6fc7601f739c39f21` and refreshed the stack.

# ServiceRadar v1.0.59

Identity reconciliation sweep merge and demo rollout.

## Whats New

**1.0.59**
- Merged sweep sightings directly into canonical devices when IPs map to strong-ID inventory, draining the ~50k backlog and surfacing sweep availability/port data on unified devices.
- Rebuilt and deployed demo images (app tag `sha-6a68e409931e4b148541b6a8eb221f4bfeb60a14`) with helm values updated and pods rolled in `demo`.
- Locked faker IP shuffle to fixed cardinality and adjusted short CI to skip long churn simulation to keep pipelines stable.

# ServiceRadar v1.0.57

Demo messaging/poller stability.

## Whats New

**1.0.57**
- Increased NATS defaults to 1Gi/4Gi and rebuilt the JetStream pod to avoid OOM loops during KV/events recovery in the demo release.
- Raised poller defaults to 512Mi/1Gi so sweep workloads streaming ~50k devices no longer OOMKill; chart values now persist the fix.

# ServiceRadar v1.0.56

Helm demo hardening: flowgger OpenSSL fix, agent/poller stability.

## Whats New

**1.0.56**
- Rebuilt flowgger on a Debian testing base so OpenSSL 3.2 symbols are present, removed the init-container hack, and switched probes to TCP on 50044. Published as `ghcr.io/carverauto/serviceradar-flowgger:1.0.56`.
- Bumped agent defaults to 200m/512Mi requests and 500m/1Gi limits to avoid OOMs during sweep workloads; poller probes now use TCP instead of netcat to drop libbsd dependency.
- Added CNPG app bootstrap job to create/own the `serviceradar` DB/user with charted credentials and grant privileges automatically on install/upgrade.
- Ensured poller ServiceAccount is rendered so the deployment can schedule cleanly.

# ServiceRadar v1.0.55

ARC runner and release hardening.

## Whats New

**1.0.55**
- Published a custom ARC runner image with cmake, flex/bison, perl, protoc, and OpenSSL headers so Bazel genrules no longer depend on GitHub runner OS packages.
- Wired TimescaleDB/AGE builds to use bundled toolchain binaries and resolved Bazel protoc selection in the rperf checker build script for reliable remote execution.
- Defaulted release builds to skip Turbopack and vendored OpenSSL to reduce host coupling on ephemeral runners.
- Re-cut release after stabilizing ARC runner autoscaling and exporting OpenSSL paths for RBE.

# ServiceRadar v1.0.54

TimescaleDB extension rebuild for CNPG image.

## Whats New

**1.0.54**
- Bundled a hermetic CMake into the TimescaleDB extension layer build so Bazel releases succeed even when executors lack cmake, re-cutting the v1.0.54 tag.
- Added Debian/Ubuntu GCC 11 built-in include directories to the BuildBuddy toolchain so protobuf/utf8_range builds stop failing with absolute include path checks during artifact publishing.

# ServiceRadar v1.0.54-pre6

Core admin UI polish and onboarding fixes.

## Whats New

**1.0.54-pre6**
- Added a sticky navigation rail plus mobile jump links for the Core Admin configuration form, and defaulted the heaviest panels (RBAC, Webhooks, Write Buffer) to collapsed view for faster scanning.
- Reworked edge onboarding to surface decoded key length/hex, support editing raw hex with automatic re-encoding, and generally structure default metadata inputs so operators can edit settings without dropping to JSON.
- Removed the SRQL editor in favor of the managed srql service; the integrations panel now only exposes MCP credentials with masked/copyable input.

# ServiceRadar v1.0.54-pre5

Release automation fixes (BuildBuddy remote execution).

## Whats New

**1.0.54-pre5**
- Release workflow now writes the full BuildBuddy remote cache/executor configuration so Bazel invocations run on the RBE cluster during artifact publishing.
- Applied the same remote defaults when seeding `.bazelrc.remote` to keep Docker image and package pushes off the GitHub runner.
- macOS sysmon VM package is now excluded automatically when the build host lacks the macOS toolchain, fixing Linux release runs.

# ServiceRadar v1.0.54-pre4

Release automation updates.

## Whats New

**1.0.54-pre4**
- Updated the GitHub release workflow to provide full BuildBuddy remote execution settings so release builds publish from the RBE cluster instead of the runner.

# ServiceRadar v1.0.53

## Whats New

**1.0.53**

# ServiceRadar v1.0.53-pre20

GHCR manifest refresh and release automation updates.

## Whats New

- GitHub release workflow now authenticates to GHCR and pushes Bazel-built images before uploading packages.
- Docker quick start docs now require `docker-compose pull` to ensure deployments use the refreshed images.
- Removed the default compose override that forced `:local` tags, eliminating manifest errors for fresh installs.

# ServiceRadar v1.0.53-pre19

Bazel container fixes for runtime parity.

## Whats New

**1.0.53-pre19**
- Enforced pure Go mode in Bazel so every shipped binary is static and CGO-free.
- Layered Alpine ping, nmap, and netcat APKs into all OCI images that expect those tools at runtime.
