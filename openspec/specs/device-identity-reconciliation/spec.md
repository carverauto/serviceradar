# device-identity-reconciliation Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change fix-identity-batch-lookup-partition. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Partition-Scoped Batch Identifier Lookup
The system MUST resolve strong identifiers in batch mode within the update's partition, and MUST NOT match identifiers across partitions.

#### Scenario: Same identifier in different partitions
- **WHEN** two device updates in the same batch share the same strong identifier value but have different partitions
- **THEN** each update resolves to the device ID that matches its own partition

#### Scenario: Empty partition defaults consistently
- **WHEN** a device update has an empty partition value
- **THEN** identifier resolution treats it as partition `default` for both single and batch lookup paths

### Requirement: CNPG-Authoritative Identity Canonicalization
The system SHALL treat CNPG (via `IdentityEngine` + `DeviceRegistry`) as the authoritative source of canonical device identity, and SHALL NOT rely on KV as the source of truth for identity reconciliation.

#### Scenario: Registry processes updates without KV
- **WHEN** the core registry processes a batch of device updates
- **THEN** canonical device IDs are resolved and persisted via CNPG-backed identity reconciliation
- **AND** the registry does not require KV to be available to complete identity reconciliation

### Requirement: KV Identity Lookups Are Cache-Only
The system MAY use KV as a cache/hydration layer for limited identity lookups (e.g., IP and partition:IP used during sweep processing), but MUST continue to resolve identities correctly when KV is unavailable.

#### Scenario: KV miss falls back to CNPG
- **WHEN** a canonical identity lookup misses in KV
- **THEN** the system falls back to CNPG-backed lookup paths
- **AND** MAY hydrate the KV cache from the CNPG result
