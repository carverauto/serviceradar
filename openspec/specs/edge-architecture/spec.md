## Requirements
### Requirement: Edge Network Isolation

Edge components (agents, checkers) deployed in customer networks SHALL NOT join the ERTS Erlang cluster. Communication between edge and platform SHALL use gRPC with mTLS only.

#### Scenario: Edge agent cannot execute RPC on core
- **WHEN** an agent is deployed in customer network
- **AND** attempts to call `:rpc.call(core_node, Module, :function, [args])`

- **AND** the agent has no knowledge of core node names

#### Scenario: Edge agent cannot enumerate cluster processes
- **WHEN** an agent is deployed in customer network
- **AND** attempts to query Horde registries
- **THEN** the query fails because agent is not a cluster member
