# edge-architecture Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change remove-elixir-edge-agent. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Edge Network Isolation

Edge components (agents, checkers) deployed in customer networks SHALL NOT join the ERTS Erlang cluster. Communication between edge and platform SHALL use gRPC with mTLS only.

#### Scenario: Edge agent cannot execute RPC on core
- **WHEN** an agent is deployed in customer network
- **AND** attempts to call `:rpc.call(core_node, Module, :function, [args])`
- **THEN** the call fails because no ERTS connection exists
- **AND** the agent has no knowledge of core node names

#### Scenario: Edge agent cannot enumerate cluster processes
- **WHEN** an agent is deployed in customer network
- **AND** attempts to query Horde registries
- **THEN** the query fails because agent is not a cluster member
- **AND** the agent cannot discover other tenants' processes

#### Scenario: Edge communicates via gRPC only
- **WHEN** an agent needs to report data to the platform
- **THEN** it initiates a gRPC connection to the gateway
- **AND** pushes status updates via gRPC
- **AND** no Erlang distribution protocol is used

### Requirement: Internal ERTS Cluster

Platform services (core, gateway, web-ng) running in Kubernetes SHALL form an ERTS Erlang cluster for distributed coordination. This cluster SHALL NOT include edge components.

#### Scenario: Horde registry for gateways
- **WHEN** gateways need to coordinate work distribution
- **THEN** they use Horde distributed registry
- **AND** only platform nodes participate in Horde

#### Scenario: Oban job scheduling across nodes
- **WHEN** scheduled jobs need to run
- **THEN** Oban coordinates via ERTS cluster
- **AND** jobs run on available platform nodes

#### Scenario: Phoenix PubSub for real-time updates
- **WHEN** real-time updates need to broadcast
- **THEN** Phoenix PubSub uses ERTS cluster
- **AND** web-ng receives updates from core/gateway

### Requirement: mTLS Agent Authentication

Edge agents SHALL authenticate using mTLS client certificates. Certificates SHALL encode tenant identity for multi-tenant isolation.

#### Scenario: Agent presents tenant certificate
- **WHEN** a gateway connects to an agent
- **THEN** mTLS handshake requires client certificate from gateway
- **AND** agent verifies gateway certificate is from platform CA

#### Scenario: Gateway verifies agent tenant
- **WHEN** a gateway receives data from an agent
- **THEN** the gateway extracts tenant ID from agent certificate
- **AND** verifies agent belongs to expected tenant
- **AND** rejects cross-tenant data

#### Scenario: Certificate encodes tenant identity
- **WHEN** an agent certificate is issued during onboarding
- **THEN** the certificate CN contains tenant slug
- **AND** SPIFFE ID encodes tenant workload identity
- **AND** certificate is signed by tenant-specific intermediate CA

### Requirement: Agent-Initiated Communication

Edge agents SHALL initiate gRPC connections to gateway endpoints to push status updates and results. Gateways SHALL NOT initiate outbound connections to edge agents.

#### Scenario: Agent pushes status to gateway
- **WHEN** an edge agent collects monitoring data
- **THEN** it opens a gRPC connection to the gateway endpoint
- **AND** it calls `PushStatus` or `StreamStatus` with the payload

#### Scenario: Gateway does not poll agents
- **WHEN** a gateway needs agent data
- **THEN** it waits for the agent to push updates
- **AND** it does not dial the agent endpoint directly

#### Scenario: Onboarding provides gateway endpoint
- **WHEN** an edge agent starts after onboarding
- **THEN** it receives the gateway endpoint in its configuration
- **AND** uses that endpoint to establish the gRPC session

### Requirement: Sysmon Metrics Ingestion

Sysmon metrics pushed via gRPC SHALL be routed to core ingestion and stored in tenant-scoped hypertables.

#### Scenario: Sysmon metrics forwarded to core
- **WHEN** an edge agent emits sysmon metrics
- **AND** the payload is sent with `source=sysmon-metrics`
- **THEN** the gateway forwards the payload to core ingestion
- **AND** core writes CPU, CPU cluster, memory, disk, and process metrics into tenant schemas

#### Scenario: Sysmon payload size tolerance
- **WHEN** a sysmon metrics payload exceeds the standard status size limit
- **THEN** the gateway accepts the larger payload up to the configured sysmon limit
- **AND** oversized payloads are rejected explicitly

### Requirement: Per-tenant gateway pools
The platform SHALL run a dedicated gateway pool per tenant, and each gateway instance SHALL register and operate only within that tenant scope.

#### Scenario: Tenant-specific gateway pool
- **GIVEN** tenant "acme" is provisioned
- **WHEN** gateway pools are created
- **THEN** at least one gateway instance is assigned to tenant "acme"
- **AND** that gateway is not eligible to serve other tenants

#### Scenario: Multi-gateway HA per tenant
- **GIVEN** tenant "acme" has two gateway instances
- **WHEN** one instance becomes unavailable
- **THEN** agent connections for tenant "acme" continue via the remaining instance
- **AND** cross-tenant traffic is never routed to the pool

### Requirement: Tenant-scoped gateway registration
Gateway registry entries SHALL include tenant identifiers and SHALL be used for tenant-scoped routing and coordination.

#### Scenario: Registry is tenant-scoped
- **WHEN** a gateway registers itself in the cluster
- **THEN** the registry entry includes the tenant identifier
- **AND** scheduling/routing queries only consider gateways for the same tenant

### Requirement: Platform SPIFFE mTLS for internal gRPC
Platform services that communicate with datasvc via gRPC (web-ng, core-elx) SHALL support SPIFFE SVID-based mTLS inside Kubernetes clusters. Datasvc SHALL validate SPIFFE identities for those clients. When SPIFFE Workload API mode is enabled, Elixir services SHALL fetch X.509 SVIDs via the SPIRE agent socket. When SPIFFE is disabled, those services SHALL use file-based mTLS configuration so Docker Compose and non-SPIFFE environments remain functional.

#### Scenario: SPIFFE-enabled web-ng connects to datasvc
- **GIVEN** SPIFFE is enabled for the cluster
- **AND** web-ng has access to the SPIRE agent socket
- **WHEN** web-ng establishes a gRPC channel to datasvc
- **THEN** the connection uses a SPIFFE SVID for client authentication
- **AND** datasvc validates the SPIFFE identity of web-ng

#### Scenario: SPIFFE Workload API supplies SVIDs for Elixir services
- **GIVEN** SPIFFE Workload API mode is enabled
- **AND** the SPIRE agent socket is available in the pod
- **WHEN** web-ng or core-elx needs a gRPC client certificate
- **THEN** the service fetches an X.509 SVID and bundle from the Workload API
- **AND** the resulting mTLS credentials are used for the gRPC connection

#### Scenario: SPIFFE disabled uses file-based mTLS
- **GIVEN** SPIFFE is disabled for the deployment
- **WHEN** web-ng connects to datasvc
- **THEN** web-ng uses file-based mTLS certificates configured via environment variables
- **AND** the connection succeeds without SPIFFE dependencies

### Requirement: Helm deploys agent-gateway with edge mTLS
Helm installs SHALL deploy serviceradar-agent-gateway when enabled in values. The workload SHALL serve edge-facing gRPC over tenant-issued mTLS certificates. The gateway SHALL NOT use SPIFFE identities. Deployments that disable the gateway SHALL not render gateway workloads.

#### Scenario: Agent-gateway is deployed by Helm
- **GIVEN** a Helm install with agent-gateway enabled
- **WHEN** the chart is rendered and applied
- **THEN** a serviceradar-agent-gateway Deployment and Service are created
- **AND** the gateway pod reaches Ready state

#### Scenario: Gateway workload omits SPIRE socket
- **GIVEN** the agent-gateway workload is deployed
- **WHEN** the pod specification is inspected
- **THEN** the SPIRE agent socket is not mounted
- **AND** the gateway serves edge gRPC using tenant-issued mTLS only

#### Scenario: Gateway disabled removes workloads
- **GIVEN** a Helm install with agent-gateway disabled
- **WHEN** the chart is rendered
- **THEN** no serviceradar-agent-gateway Deployment or Service is created

### Requirement: Agent-gateway uses tenant CA for edge mTLS
The agent-gateway SHALL use tenant-issued mTLS certificates for edge agent connections and MUST reject edge connections that are not signed by the expected tenant CA. The gateway's internal control-plane communication SHALL use ERTS where applicable and does not require SPIFFE.

#### Scenario: Gateway uses tenant CA for edge mTLS
- **GIVEN** an edge agent presents a certificate signed by the tenant CA
- **WHEN** the agent connects to the gateway
- **THEN** the mTLS handshake succeeds
- **AND** the gateway derives tenant identity from the certificate

#### Scenario: Gateway rejects unknown tenant CA
- **GIVEN** an edge agent presents a certificate signed by an unknown CA
- **WHEN** the agent connects to the gateway
- **THEN** the gateway rejects the connection

### Requirement: Results ingestion uses gRPC/ERTS routing
The system SHALL ingest sync and sweep results through the gRPC/ERTS results pipeline, with agent-gateway forwarding results directly to core without requiring NATS for ingestion.

#### Scenario: Sync results ingestion via gRPC
- **GIVEN** an agent streams sync results through the gateway
- **WHEN** the gateway forwards the results to core
- **THEN** core SHALL enqueue the sync payload through the results ingestion pipeline
- **AND** the ingest SHALL succeed without NATS dependencies

#### Scenario: Sweep results ingestion via gRPC
- **GIVEN** an agent streams sweep results through the gateway
- **WHEN** the gateway forwards the results to core
- **THEN** core SHALL ingest sweep data and update device inventory
- **AND** the ingest SHALL succeed without NATS dependencies

### Requirement: Results routing is explicit by result type
The core results pipeline SHALL route sync and sweep results by type using dedicated handlers instead of relying on generic status handling.

#### Scenario: Results routing selects the correct handler
- **GIVEN** core receives a gRPC results payload tagged as `sync`
- **WHEN** the results pipeline processes the payload
- **THEN** it SHALL dispatch to the sync ingestor
- **AND** sweep payloads SHALL dispatch to the sweep ingestor

### Requirement: Sysmon metrics ingestion via gRPC
The system SHALL ingest sysmon metrics delivered over gRPC status updates into the tenant-scoped CNPG hypertables (`cpu_metrics`, `cpu_cluster_metrics`, `memory_metrics`, `disk_metrics`, and `process_metrics`).

#### Scenario: Sysmon metrics persisted for the agent device
- **GIVEN** an agent streams a `sysmon-metrics` status payload for tenant `platform`
- **WHEN** the gateway forwards the status update to core
- **THEN** core SHALL resolve the agent's device identifier
- **AND** core SHALL insert the parsed metrics into the `tenant_platform` hypertables

#### Scenario: Device mapping unavailable
- **GIVEN** an agent streams a `sysmon-metrics` status payload but has no linked device record
- **WHEN** the gateway forwards the status update to core
- **THEN** core SHALL ingest the metrics with a safe fallback device identifier or leave it null
- **AND** the ingest SHALL NOT fail due to missing device linkage

### Requirement: Sysmon payload size handling
The gateway SHALL accept `sysmon-metrics` payloads larger than the default status message limit and forward them without truncation.

#### Scenario: Large sysmon payload
- **GIVEN** a `sysmon-metrics` status payload larger than 4KB
- **WHEN** the gateway processes the message
- **THEN** the payload SHALL be accepted up to the configured sysmon limit
- **AND** the payload SHALL be forwarded to core intact

### Requirement: Mapper discovery runs inside the agent
The system SHALL run mapper discovery jobs inside `serviceradar-agent` and SHALL NOT deploy a standalone mapper service in default deployments.

#### Scenario: Deployment excludes mapper workload
- **GIVEN** a standard deployment (Helm or Compose)
- **WHEN** workloads are rendered or started
- **THEN** no `serviceradar-mapper` deployment or container is created
- **AND** mapper discovery is executed by the agent runtime

#### Scenario: Agent executes mapper discovery job
- **GIVEN** an agent with mapper config assigned
- **WHEN** the scheduled mapper job interval elapses
- **THEN** the agent executes mapper discovery locally
- **AND** records job status for reporting

### Requirement: Mapper discovery results ingestion via gRPC
Mapper discovery results SHALL be submitted by agents to the gateway via gRPC and forwarded to core ingestion without requiring a standalone mapper service.

#### Scenario: Agent pushes mapper discovery results
- **GIVEN** an agent completes a mapper discovery job
- **WHEN** it calls `PushResults` (or equivalent) with `result_type = mapper_discovery`
- **THEN** the gateway SHALL forward the results to core
- **AND** core SHALL ingest the discovery results into device inventory streams

#### Scenario: Mapper results routing is explicit
- **GIVEN** core receives a mapper discovery results payload
- **WHEN** the results pipeline processes the payload
- **THEN** it SHALL dispatch to the mapper discovery handler
- **AND** results SHALL not be treated as generic status updates
