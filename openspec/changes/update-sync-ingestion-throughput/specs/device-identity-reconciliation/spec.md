## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Tenant-Scoped Sync Ingestion Queue
The system SHALL enqueue sync result chunks per tenant and coalesce bursts within a configurable window before ingestion to smooth database load while preserving per-tenant ordering.

#### Scenario: Burst of sync results
- **WHEN** multiple sync result chunks arrive for the same tenant within the coalescing window
- **THEN** core SHALL merge the chunks into a single ingestion batch for that tenant
- **AND** ingestion for the tenant SHALL proceed in arrival order after coalescing
- **AND** the number of concurrent tenant ingestion workers SHALL be bounded by configuration
