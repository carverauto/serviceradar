## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Edge Network Isolation

Edge components (agents, checkers) deployed in customer networks SHALL NOT join the ERTS Erlang cluster. Communication between edge and platform SHALL use gRPC with mTLS only.

#### Scenario: Edge agent cannot execute RPC on core
- **WHEN** an agent is deployed in customer network
- **AND** attempts to call `:rpc.call(core_node, Module, :function, [args])`
- **THEN** the call fails because no ERTS connection exists
- **AND** the agent has no knowledge of core node names

#### Scenario: Edge agent cannot enumerate cluster processes
- **WHEN** an agent is deployed in customer network
- **AND** attempts to query Horde registries
- **THEN** the query fails because agent is not a cluster member
- **AND** the agent cannot discover other tenants' processes

#### Scenario: Edge communicates via gRPC only
- **WHEN** an agent needs to report data to the platform
- **THEN** it initiates a gRPC connection to the gateway
- **AND** pushes status updates via gRPC
- **AND** no Erlang distribution protocol is used

### Requirement: Agent-Initiated Communication

Edge agents SHALL initiate gRPC connections to gateway endpoints to push status updates and results. Gateways SHALL NOT initiate outbound connections to edge agents.

#### Scenario: Agent pushes status to gateway
- **WHEN** an edge agent collects monitoring data
- **THEN** it opens a gRPC connection to the gateway endpoint
- **AND** it calls `PushStatus` or `StreamStatus` with the payload

#### Scenario: Gateway does not poll agents
- **WHEN** a gateway needs agent data
- **THEN** it waits for the agent to push updates
- **AND** it does not dial the agent endpoint directly

#### Scenario: Onboarding provides gateway endpoint
- **WHEN** an edge agent starts after onboarding
- **THEN** it receives the gateway endpoint in its configuration
- **AND** uses that endpoint to establish the gRPC session

### Requirement: Internal ERTS Cluster

Platform services (core, gateway, web-ng) running in Kubernetes SHALL form an ERTS Erlang cluster for distributed coordination. This cluster SHALL NOT include edge components.

#### Scenario: Horde registry for gateways
- **WHEN** gateways need to coordinate work distribution
- **THEN** they use Horde distributed registry
- **AND** only platform nodes participate in Horde

#### Scenario: Oban job scheduling across nodes
- **WHEN** scheduled jobs need to run
- **THEN** Oban coordinates via ERTS cluster
- **AND** jobs run on available platform nodes

#### Scenario: Phoenix PubSub for real-time updates
- **WHEN** real-time updates need to broadcast
- **THEN** Phoenix PubSub uses ERTS cluster
- **AND** web-ng receives updates from core/gateway

### Requirement: mTLS Agent Authentication

Edge agents SHALL authenticate using mTLS client certificates. Certificates SHALL encode tenant identity for multi-tenant isolation.

#### Scenario: Agent presents tenant certificate
- **WHEN** a gateway connects to an agent
- **THEN** mTLS handshake requires client certificate from gateway
- **AND** agent verifies gateway certificate is from platform CA

#### Scenario: Gateway verifies agent tenant
- **WHEN** a gateway receives data from an agent
- **THEN** the gateway extracts tenant ID from agent certificate
- **AND** verifies agent belongs to expected tenant
- **AND** rejects cross-tenant data

#### Scenario: Certificate encodes tenant identity
- **WHEN** an agent certificate is issued during onboarding
- **THEN** the certificate CN contains tenant slug
- **AND** SPIFFE ID encodes tenant workload identity
- **AND** certificate is signed by tenant-specific intermediate CA
