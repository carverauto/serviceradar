## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Active Camera Analysis Worker Probing
The platform SHALL actively probe registered camera analysis workers so worker health state is refreshed even when no relay-scoped analysis dispatch is in flight.

#### Scenario: Enabled worker passes active probe
- **WHEN** a registered enabled analysis worker responds successfully to the platform probe
- **THEN** the platform marks the worker healthy
- **AND** updates the worker health timestamps and clears stale failure reason state

#### Scenario: Enabled worker fails active probe
- **WHEN** a registered enabled analysis worker times out, returns a transport failure, or returns a non-success probe response
- **THEN** the platform marks the worker unhealthy
- **AND** records a normalized health reason and failure timestamp

### Requirement: Health-Aware Selection Uses Active Probe State
Capability-based worker selection SHALL honor the latest active probe health state stored in the worker registry.

#### Scenario: Capability selection skips actively unhealthy workers
- **WHEN** a capability-targeted analysis branch is opened
- **AND** one matching worker is unhealthy from active probing
- **THEN** the platform does not select that worker while a healthy compatible worker exists

#### Scenario: Explicit worker targeting remains fail-fast
- **WHEN** a branch explicitly targets a registered worker id
- **AND** that worker is unhealthy from active probing
- **THEN** the platform fails branch creation instead of silently rerouting to another worker
