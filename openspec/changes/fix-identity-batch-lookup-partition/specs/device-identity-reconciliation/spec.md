## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Partition-Scoped Batch Identifier Lookup
The system MUST resolve strong identifiers in batch mode within the update's partition, and MUST NOT match identifiers across partitions.

#### Scenario: Same identifier in different partitions
- **WHEN** two device updates in the same batch share the same strong identifier value but have different partitions
- **THEN** each update resolves to the device ID that matches its own partition

#### Scenario: Empty partition defaults consistently
- **WHEN** a device update has an empty partition value
- **THEN** identifier resolution treats it as partition `default` for both single and batch lookup paths
