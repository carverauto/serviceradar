# PRD: AIOps Capabilities for ServiceRadar with DeepCausality

**Author:** [Michael Freeman]
**Date:** June 22, 2025
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements for integrating the **DeepCausality** library into the **ServiceRadar** network management application. This integration will transform ServiceRadar from a traditional monitoring system into a sophisticated AIOps platform. By leveraging hyper-geometric computational causality, ServiceRadar will gain the ability to perform advanced root cause analysis (RCA), predict system failures before they occur, and provide actionable, context-aware insights to operators, thereby significantly reducing downtime and operational overhead.

### 1.2. Problem Statement

Modern IT environments are complex and distributed. When a service fails, identifying the root cause is a time-consuming and often manual process of sifting through logs, metrics, and events from disparate systems. ServiceRadar currently excels at *detecting* failures but lacks the capability to *diagnose* their underlying causes automatically.

Operators are inundated with alerts, many of which are symptoms of a single root problem, leading to alert fatigue. Furthermore, the current system is reactive; it reports issues only after they have occurred. This leads to longer Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) and impacts service availability.

### 1.3. Goals

The primary goals of this integration are:

*   **Reduce Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR):** Automatically identify the root cause of service failures, enabling operators to fix problems faster.
*   **Decrease Alert Noise:** Correlate related events and suppress symptomatic alerts, presenting operators with a single, actionable root cause alert.
*   **Enable Proactive Monitoring:** Shift from a reactive to a predictive monitoring model by identifying patterns that signal impending failures.
*   **Enhance Operator Efficiency:** Provide clear, contextual, and causal explanations for incidents, reducing the need for manual investigation.

## 2. User Personas

*   **DevOps Engineer / SRE (Alice):** Alice is responsible for maintaining the reliability and uptime of production services. She needs to quickly diagnose and resolve incidents. She would use the new AIOps features to understand why a service went down without having to manually correlate data from multiple dashboards.
*   **Network Administrator (Bob):** Bob manages the network infrastructure. When an application team reports a problem, he needs to determine if it's a network issue. The causal analysis would help him immediately see if network performance degradation is the root cause of an application failure.
*   **IT Manager (Carol):** Carol oversees the IT operations team. Her goal is to improve operational efficiency and reduce downtime. The predictive capabilities and reduced MTTR directly contribute to her KPIs.

## 3. Features & Requirements

### 3.1. Advanced Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

#### Description

When a service failure is detected, ServiceRadar will use DeepCausality to analyze data from multiple sources and identify the most likely causal event. The multi-context capability of DeepCausality is key to this feature.

#### Requirements

*   **Multi-Context Data Modeling:** The ServiceRadar Core Service will feed data into separate DeepCausality contexts:
    *   **Network Context:** `rperf` data (latency, jitter, packet loss).
    *   **Host Context:** Agent data (process status, CPU/memory usage, port availability).
    *   **Configuration Context:** Data from the KV Store regarding configuration changes, device additions, etc., synced via the Sync Service.
    *   **Dependency Context:** A model of service dependencies (e.g., Web UI depends on Core API, which depends on the Proton Database).
*   **Causal Model Execution:** Upon detecting a service failure, the Core Service will trigger a causal analysis model.
*   **Enriched Alerting:** The resulting alert will be enriched with the identified root cause.
    *   **Example Alert:** "Service 'Web-UI' is down. **Root Cause:** High packet loss detected on host `10.1.1.5` starting at 14:32 UTC. This host's network configuration was modified at 14:30 UTC."
*   **User Story:** As Alice, when I receive an alert that the payment gateway is down, I want the system to tell me that the cause was a database configuration change, so I don't waste time investigating the application servers.

### 3.2. Predictive Failure Analysis

#### Description

Leverage DeepCausality to identify precursor patterns that indicate a high probability of future failure, allowing operators to intervene proactively.

#### Requirements

*   **Temporal Pattern Recognition:** The system will analyze time-series data from the Proton database to build causal models of pre-failure states.
*   **Predictive Alerting:** When a known pre-failure pattern is detected, a new type of "predictive" or "warning" alert will be generated.
    *   **Example Alert:** "**PREDICTIVE ALERT:** Service 'API-Gateway' is at high risk of failure. Memory usage has been increasing by 5% every 10 minutes for the past hour, while response latency has increased by 20ms. This pattern has led to failure in 95% of past occurrences."
*   **Configurable Models:** Provide a mechanism (e.g., a JSON configuration) to define the causaloids or patterns to look for.
*   **User Story:** As Bob, I want to be notified when network jitter on the VoIP gateway is trending upwards in a way that historically leads to call quality degradation, so I can fix it before users complain.

### 3.3. Causal Graph Visualization

#### Description

Provide a user interface within the ServiceRadar Web UI to visualize the chain of causal events that led to an incident.

#### Requirements

*   **Timeline View:** Display a timeline of events leading up to and including the failure.
*   **Graph Visualization:** For a given incident, render a directed graph showing the nodes (services, hosts, configurations) and edges (causal relationships) that connect the root cause to the final symptom.
*   **Interactive Exploration:** Allow users to click on nodes in the graph to see detailed metrics and logs for that component at that point in time.
*   **Integration with Alerts:** Alerts in the dashboard should link directly to the causal graph visualization for that incident.
*   **User Story:** As Alice, after seeing a root cause alert, I want to view a graph that visually explains the connection between a code deployment, a subsequent database slowdown, and the eventual application timeout.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:** Causal analysis should complete within seconds of a detected failure to ensure timely alerting. The overhead of running the DeepCausality library should not significantly impact the performance of the Core Service.
*   **Scalability:** The system must be able to handle causal analysis for thousands of monitored services and devices across hundreds of hosts.
*   **Extensibility:** Adding new contexts or causal models should be possible through configuration without requiring a full system re-architecture.
*   **Accuracy:** The RCA models should have a high degree of precision and recall to ensure operator trust. The system must provide a mechanism for feedback to improve the models over time (future release).

## 5. Rollout Plan

### Phase 1: Backend Integration & Core RCA

*   Integrate the DeepCausality library into the ServiceRadar Core Service.
*   Implement the multi-context data ingestion pipeline.
*   Develop the first set of causal models for basic root cause analysis (e.g., linking network issues to service failures).
*   Implement enriched alerting via webhooks.
*   **Goal:** Deliver initial RCA capabilities to a select group of internal users.

### Phase 2: Predictive Analysis & Model Expansion

*   Develop and deploy predictive failure models.
*   Introduce the "predictive alert" type.
*   Expand the library of causal models to cover more complex scenarios (e.g., multi-service cascading failures).
*   **Goal:** Enable proactive monitoring and reduce the frequency of reactive incidents.

### Phase 3: UI Visualization & General Availability

*   Develop the Causal Graph Visualization component in the Web UI.
*   Integrate the visualization with the alerting system.
*   Refine models based on feedback from earlier phases.
*   **Goal:** Make the full AIOps feature set available to all users.

## 6. Success Metrics

*   **Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR):** A reduction of at least 30% in the average time from incident detection to resolution.
*   **Alert Noise Reduction:** A 50% or greater reduction in the total number of alerts generated for a single incident.
*   **Predictive Alert Success Rate:** At least 70% of predictive alerts are confirmed to be valid potential incidents by operators.
*   **User Adoption:** The percentage of incidents where operators use the causal analysis features to guide their response.
