# ServiceRadar Atlas proposal review evidence

This documents the reduced `add-topology-bitmap-query-index` design. It is
artifact validation, not proof that the implementation or rollout is complete.

## Artifacts

| Artifact | SHA-256 | Bytes |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| [Architecture source](topology-bitmap-index.architecture.json) | `dafe233cc5fdac61462a4dca39eb0624d9420cd49bc2d060872bbae26f9a317c` | 3688 |
| [Architecture HTML](topology-bitmap-index.html) | `64ca70e0515cbd6053f7d6504da030c94192ad94e26ab5086a87aab764ed3209` | 707942 |
| [Portable proposal](topology-bitmap-index-proposal.html) | `4ba374582a9db7da312daa5974386f066308436acca78fb962875c1625fc3f1f` | 861474 |

The portable proposal embeds checksummed copies of the approved proposal,
design, delta requirements, implementation tasks and review response. It also
embeds the architecture viewer. This snapshot explains server-side Roaring,
current-membership query pages, admitted-row SRMO replacements and binary SRTO
health/flow. It removes the discarded browser Roaring/WASM, XOR/chunks, outbox,
interface dictionary, owner routing and result cache designs. Source documents
remain authoritative as implementation proceeds.

The Atlas naming refresh includes the approved visible filter builder, literal
tag prefixes, current device/interface IP CIDR matching, named Prefix Tags and
the third review response. The source snapshot retains explicit unfinished
acceptance tasks, compression measurement and the deferred Arrow telemetry
follow-up. Code identifiers and protocol names remain unchanged.

Colors and typography follow existing ServiceRadar styles. All viewer assets
are embedded; no external assets are required. This refresh reuses the portable
artifact shell and does not use a Lavish export.

## Validation

Archify `validate` and `deliver` passed 9/9 architecture/showcase checks with
zero composition errors and warnings. The delivered HTML binds the exact source
bytes listed above. This refresh required no visual correction rounds.

Archify `visual-check` passed against that HTML at 1440 x 900, 1600 x 1000,
1920 x 1080 and 2048 x 1320. Each document matched its viewport without overflow.
The [machine receipt](topology-bitmap-index.visual-check.json) and
[light/dark contact sheet](topology-bitmap-index.visual-check.html) are retained.

Perceptual review separately inspected all four light/dark endpoint screenshots:
node names, relationship labels and cards were readable without overlap or
clipping. `visual_review: passed`. Automated checks retain their own separate
visual-review field.

The portable proposal also loaded in Chrome in both themes at 1470 x 780 and
at a narrow width of 500 pixels. Its five embedded source sections and diagram
loaded. Document width matched viewport width; vertical scrolling is intentional.
This is an artifact spot check, not product performance acceptance.

Product GPU evidence is recorded separately in
[the synthetic hardware acceptance report](../topology-bitmap-gpu-acceptance.md).
Repository-wide testing and production-route acceptance belong to the integrated
implementation; no previous proposal-only test run is claimed for this refresh.
